# House pricing with machine learning 
## a study of the Copenhagen housing market 2016-2020

Welcome to the GitHub repository behind my master's thesis.\
Here, all Python code laying the foundation of the study can be found in notebook form.\
The files cover:

* Data scraping
* Data cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis
* Linear models
* Neural network models

For replication of the results, one should read the files in the above order, since data is saved and loaded along the way.
Hopefully this will be useful for whoever interested, and if any problems or questions arise, I can be contacted at fredbuscma@gmail.com.

Cheers.
